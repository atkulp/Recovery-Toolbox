        <h1>Personal Values Card Sort Exercise</h1>
    </header>

    <article>
        <p>This is an exercise to help you identify and prioritize some of the most important values you
        hold. Values may be considered as &ldquo;guiding lights&rdquo; or aspirational principles that are core to
        who you are as a person and can help guide your actions and decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Preparing for the exercise</h2>
        <p>The exercise can be done online <a href="index.html">here</a></p>

        The complete card set can also be printed so the exercise can be completed offline
         <a href="printable.html">here</a>.

        <h2>Engaging in the exercise</h2>
        <p>Work through the listed values and sort them into &ldquo;Very important&rdquo;, &ldquo;Not important&rdquo;
            and &ldquo;Not important&rdquo;. The eventual goal is to narrow down a list of your top 5-10 most important values.
            Many people find it works well to do an initial sort of all the listed values and then go back and
            prioritize among the &ldquo;Most important&rdquo; category if it contains more than 10.</p>

        <p>Depending on the purpose of doing the exercise, it may be helpful to focus on most important
            values within a specific domain (e.g. professional life, personal life, parenting, etc.)</p>

        <p>The listed values are not mutually exclusive and you may feel that some overlap and/or can be
            grouped together. In that case, focus on identifying a unifying value for those that are grouped.</p>

        <p>As you engage in the exercise, consider the following:
        <ul>
            <li>What do I feel in my heart of hearts about how important this is to me? What would I
                put if no one else was looking?</li>
            <li>What is my first inclination about how important this is to me? (don&apos;t spend too much
                time debating how to sort any one value!)</li>
            <li>Don&apos;t put too much importance on the descriptor listed for a particular value. Focus on
                what the idea means to you as you sort.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
